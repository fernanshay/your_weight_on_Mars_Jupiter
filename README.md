# your_weight_on_Mars_Jupiter
Hi! here another repository, in this I made like v2 of "your_weight_on_mars", but now you can know your weight not only on Mars Planet, Also on Jupiter!!

<strong>How i did it?</strong>

Easy, in Html, just link <script> tag and the magic work starts!
  
<strong>Js</strong>

1. <strong>Create</strong> weight, earth_gravity, also mars and Jupiter_gravity Variables
2. With Prompt you claim some data to user, like their <strong>weight</strong> and <strong>wich Planet</strong>.
3. Use <strong>Conditionals</strong> to select if Mars operation or  else if Jupiter operation, with that "document.write"

That's all :)
